        <h3>4-25-15</h3>
<p>I’m nervous to work with JavaScript again since it has been so long since I did it last time. I’m also nervous to work with a team, since I’ve had poor experiences in the past. 
    However, I’m really looking forward to this course. This is something I am very interested in and want to gain some good skills for my future professional career.
</p>

<h3>5-2-15</h3>
<p>This week we did our elevator pitches. I pitched a sporting event rater app, much like Rotten Tomatoes. The purpose of the app would allow people who missed watching an event live, know whether the game was worth it or not to watch. I think that if this app doesn’t get made during the semester, it is a project that I could make in the future. I don’t think it would be too difficult, but would take some time and effort. </p>
<p>I listened to the other pitches. I thought some students had some great ideas. Most of them seemed possible. A few seemed way too complex or difficult to create, for me at least. I would like to work on a project that uses the API other another app. I would like to learn how API’s work and get a better understanding in that field. I feel like that is extremely important in today’s app world.  
</p>
<h3>5-9-15</h3>
<p>This week I taught on local storage. It was a very interesting topic for me. I ran into a few issues because I didn’t know anything about it before teaching about it. So I wasn’t able to answer all of my group members questions. Also, I’ve never really inspected cookies before, so that was fun and interesting. The big takeaway that I had from this week was learning that cookies are becoming obsolete and also the two different types of local storage: sessionStorage and localStorage. Session is temporary and ends when the tab or browser is exited or closed. localStorage lasts longer, and can be sued between tabs. The storage is also not cross browser.</p>

<h3>5-16-15</h3>
<p>This week was really difficult. I think I bit off more than I could chew with presenting on AJAX interactions. I did my best, but I still don’t understand exactly how the transactions take place. I understand the concept, but still don’t quite get it. I think Logan and Will understand better than I do, which is good for me because they are the ones teaching me each week.
I have yet to receive any grades or feedback for this class, and I’m a little worried. My grade still says ‘0%’, which still terrifies me today even though I know it is outdated. Will taught on CSS3 transitions, which I went over in CIT 230. Those I understood pretty well. Logan went over JSON, which again is something difficult for me to understand. 
</p>
<p>I ran into several problems this week with my example from AJAX interactions. Will taught about it last week, so I tried to make it more advanced. I tried explaining how a CAPCHA works. The example I found used PHP, AJAX, JavaScript and HTML. Since I don’t know any PHP, this made it even more difficult. I tried using JSfiddle.net but it doesn’t support PHP. I then did it on my own server and got it working, but it took a long time (I’m fine with, but I feel like it was just troubleshooting and I wasn’t learning too much). 
</p>
<h3>5-23-15</h3>
<p>This week was fun. I tried to create code that could be used for the app that we are most likely to create.
    I figured if I start making things that I will use in the future, I will have a better chance of understanding how it
    works and remembering how to do it. I ran into some problems with the CSS animations. I wanted to make a loading animation but 
    I needed assistance from W3 schools. I didn't want to copy the code directly and was unable to come up with anything on my own.</p>
<p>
    I also ran into issues with JavaScript. I tried using JSON objects to link data together, but that didn't work out too well. However, I was able to
    mess around with the code enough to get it to stick together, even if I don't think it will provide any use in the future app. All in all it was a fun week and I learned a lot.</p>
